# snowcodes
My winter Discord bot candidate for SnowCodes hackathon

# Day 1:
Uhh... i did nothing??

# Day 2:
I got confused what programming language to use, i wanted to use javascript cuz i never made a discord bot in it.
It was kinda hard so i'll just stick with python, i almost got demotivated btw.

I planned a few commands & random events for the bot.

# Day 3:
It's 10am and i learned about [docker compose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG6yIjZapSA), i started setting up the project :D
